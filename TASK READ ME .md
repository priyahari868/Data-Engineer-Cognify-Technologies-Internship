## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates comprehensive data engineering skills through analysis of railway operational data. The dataset contains 11,113 train records with complete information on train numbers, names, source/destination stations, and operating days. Key findings reveal CST-MUMBAI as the primary transportation hub and identify data quality issues requiring attention.

## 1. Data Exploration and Initial Assessment

### Dataset Overview
- **Total Records:** 11,113 trains
- **Columns:** 5 (Train_No, Train_Name, Source_Station_Name, Destination_Station_Name, days)
- **Data Quality:** 100% complete (no missing values)
- **Unique Trains:** 11,113 (each record represents a unique train service)

### Sample Data Structure
```
Train_No | Train_Name      | Source_Station_Name | Destination_Station_Name        | days
107      | SWV-MAO-VLNK   | SAWANTWADI ROAD     | MADGOAN JN.                     | Saturday
108      | VLNK-MAO-SWV   | MADGOAN JN.         | SAWANTWADI ROAD                 | Friday
290      | PALACE ON WH   | DELHI-SAFDAR JANG   | DELHI-SAFDAR JANG               | Wednesday
```

## 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation

### Station Name Standardization
Applied uppercase transformation to ensure consistency:
```python
df['Source_Station_Name'] = df['Source_Station_Name'].str.upper()
df['Destination_Station_Name'] = df['Destination_Station_Name'].str.upper()
```

### Data Quality Issues Identified
- **Day Name Corruption:** 10.38% of records contain corrupted day names with 'd' suffix (e.g., "Fridayd", "Mondayd")
- **Clean Records:** 89.62% have properly formatted day names
- **Action Taken:** Filtered and cleaned corrupted entries for accurate analysis

## 3. Key Analytical Findings

### Station Analysis
- **Unique Source Stations:** 921
- **Unique Destination Stations:** 924  
- **Total Unique Stations:** 933
- **Busiest Hub:** CST-MUMBAI (most common source and destination)

### Operational Patterns
- **Saturday-Only Trains:** 1,441 services
- **Express Services:** 9.90% of total trains
- **Unique Routes:** 4,883 different source-destination combinations

### Day-wise Distribution
Analysis reveals varying service levels across weekdays, with Saturday showing significant dedicated services.

## 4. Advanced Data Analysis

### Aggregation by Source Station
Created comprehensive grouping showing:
- Number of unique trains per station
- Total service records
- Average daily service frequency

Sample results:
```
Source_Station_Name | num_trains | total_records | avg_trains_per_day
CST-MUMBAI         | 156        | 156           | 22.29
NEW DELHI          | 89         | 89            | 12.71
HOWRAH JN          | 67         | 67            | 9.57
```

### Route Analysis
- **Most Connected Stations:** Major metropolitan hubs show highest connectivity
- **Service Frequency:** Varies significantly between urban and rural stations
- **Network Coverage:** Comprehensive nationwide coverage with 933 unique stations
